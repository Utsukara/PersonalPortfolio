        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am James Parker, a dedicated Master's student in Cybersecurity at DePaul University, building upon a solid foundation in Neuroscience from the University of Chicago Illinois. My academic journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of systems, data structures, and information security management, which I have further enhanced through practical experiences.

            From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology, but it wasn't until recently that I realized its potential as a career. Witnessing the increasing importance of tech in our world, I embraced this passion and transitioned into cybersecurity. My experiences as an ER Technician at Gottlieb Memorial Hospital and a Research Assistant at UIC Language Lab have honed my skills in data analysis, critical thinking, and problem-solving, all of which are crucial in the field of cybersecurity.
